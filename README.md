# `aniso`

Code (and iPython notebooks) to generate and manipulate realizations of cosmological random fields.

Originally written to study anisotropic models (hence the name) but has also been used to study velocity fields and sub-pixel 2-D aliasing.

* Note that velocites.py is stand-alone.

### TODO:
* Convert to a proper package format
  * move driver code out of package?
* Split off "anisotropic" parts of aniso.py
