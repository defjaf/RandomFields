# `aniso`

Code (and iPython notebooks) to generate and manipulate realizations of cosmological random fields.

Originally written to study anisotropic models (hence the name) but has also been used to study velocity fields and sub-pixel 2-D aliasing.

### TODO:
* Convert to a proper module format
* Split off "anisotropic" parts of aniso.py
